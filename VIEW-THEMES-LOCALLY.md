# View Themes Locally (Without Affecting Your Live Website)

## ✅ Your Live Website is Safe

Your original website has been restored and is live at:
**https://dxbqjcig99tjb.cloudfront.net**

The theme variations are stored locally and won't affect your live site.

## 🎨 Option 1: View All Themes in One Page (Recommended)

Simply open the comparison page in your browser:

```bash
open theme-comparison.html
```

Or double-click `theme-comparison.html` in your file explorer.

This will show you all 6 themes with descriptions and links to view each one full-screen.

## 🖥️ Option 2: View Individual Themes Locally

You can open any theme directly in your browser:

### Engagement-Centric Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-engagement-centric/index.html
```

### Informational Hub Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-informational-hub/index.html
```

### Multimedia Experience Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-multimedia-experience/index.html
```

### Community-Driven Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-community-driven/index.html
```

### Accessible & Responsive Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-accessible-responsive/index.html
```

### Default (Compact) Theme:
```bash
open frontend/dist-default/index.html
```

## 🌐 Option 3: Run a Local Server

For the best experience (with proper routing), run a local server:

```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server (if you don't have one)
npm install -g http-server

# Serve a specific theme
cd frontend/dist-engagement-centric
http-server -p 8080

# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

Repeat for each theme you want to test, using different ports (8081, 8082, etc.).

## 📱 Testing on Mobile

1. Start a local server (Option 3 above)
2. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
3. On your phone, visit: `http://YOUR_IP:8080`

## 🔍 What to Look For

When comparing themes, consider:

- **Visual Appeal**: Which design feels most appropriate for your mission?
- **Readability**: Can you easily read content in different sections?
- **Navigation**: Is it easy to find what you're looking for?
- **Mobile Experience**: How does it look/work on smaller screens?
- **Brand Alignment**: Does it match your grassroots, community-focused mission?
- **Accessibility**: Can users with different abilities navigate easily?
